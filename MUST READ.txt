The size of the repo was Exceeding 100MB so I have to remove the folders storing the output of trained models, You can rerun the entire code files in everything will be generated again

However the original data Used can easily be found publicly available: CIFAR-10 with Directory structure of:
	\batches.meta
	\data_batch_1
	\data_batch_2
	\data_batch_3
	\data_batch_4
	\data_batch_5
	\readme.html
	\test_batch
